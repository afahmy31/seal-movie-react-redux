# Seal Software Front-end Challenge

This is my submitted repo for the front-end challenge created by Seal Software.
This project was created using React's ```create-react-app```

This project is a simple movie browser that uses `Movie DB API`: https://developers.themoviedb.org/3 to get the most popular movies in the landing page with infinite scrolling to next pages.

The search input searches for all the movies from the `Movie DB API` using the keyword in the input field.
